# Workloads

The pre-defined workloads in PerMA-Bench are grouped into three types:

- [raw workloads](raw/): These workloads cover the four basic access patterns to PMem: sequential/random
  read/write, as well as latency measurements for random operations.

- [parallel workloads](parallel/): These workloads represent mixed database-inspired access patterns, in
  which one group of threads perform a certain access pattern and the other group performs different access.

- [operation workloads](operations/): These workloads represent access patterns of existing systems used
  in databases to get an insight into their maximum performance in PMem.
