# Represent a (hash-) join operation split into build and probe.

# The join is inspired by the PMem hash-index Dash (Lu et al., PVLDB 13(8), 2020).
# Dash has 256 Byte buckets and performs two stores for each insert.
# We represent this with an initial bucket lookup (with varying size), followed by two cache line sized writes.
# The writes are followed by a CLWB + SFENCE as in the original paper.
# We also vary the number of threads.
