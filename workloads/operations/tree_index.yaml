# Represent a (tree-) index structure split into index lookups and updates.

# The tree-index structure is inspired by FAST+FAIR (Hwang et al., FAST '18, 2018).
# As used in the original paper, we assume 512 Byte nodes, which hold 32 records.
# A tree with 100 million entries has a height of 6 (32^6 > 100 million) including
# the root. We assume the root, second, and third level to be in the L3 cache
# (32^3 * 512 Byte = ~16 MB). To find a record, we need 3 random node lookups in memory.
# For  256 Byte nodes, we assume 7 levels, where 4 levels fit into cache (~16 MB).
# For 1024 Byte nodes, we assume 5 levels, where 2 levels fit into cache (~4 MB).

# We represent a range scan via a random lookup to a start position, followed by
# 100 / (0.75 * node_capacity) additional random reads for the scan, as nodes are not
# in continuous memory. As above, a random lookup for all node sizes requires 3 hops.
# As the leaves are not fully packed, we assume a filling degree of 75%.
# For 256 Byte nodes, we need 8 extra reads, for 512 Byte 4 extra, and 2 extra for
