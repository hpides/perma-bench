# Represent a hash index split into lookups and updates.

# The index is inspired by the PMem hash-index Dash (Lu et al., PVLDB 13(8), 2020).
# Dash has 256 Byte buckets and performs two stores for each insert.
# We represent this with an initial bucket lookup (with varying size), followed by two cache line sized writes.
# The writes are followed by a CLWB + SFENCE as in the original paper.
# We also vary the number of threads.

# Based on Dash's displacement bucket design, we read two consecutive buckets for each lookup.
# We double the sizes of the buckets used in the build benchmark to represent this.
