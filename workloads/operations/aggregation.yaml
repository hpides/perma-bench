# Represent a (hash-) aggregation operation.

# The aggregation is inspired by the PMem hash-index Dash (Lu et al., PVLDB 13(8), 2020).
# Dash has 256 Byte buckets and performs two stores for each insert. As the persistence
# of the intermediate index is not important, we omit the flush/barrier after inserting.
# We use a 2 GB memory range to represent the small structure.
