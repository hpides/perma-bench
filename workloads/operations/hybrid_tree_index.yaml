# Represent a hybrid tree-index structure split into index lookups and updates.

# The tree-index structure is inspired by FPTree (Oukid et al., SIGMOD, 2016).
# As in the original paper, we assume 1024 Byte leaf nodes, which hold 64 records and 2048 Byte inner nodes, which
# hold 128 records. A tree with 1 billion entries has a height of 6 (128^4 inner nodes * 64 keys per leaf node > 1
# billion) including the root. We assume the root, first and second level to be in the L3 cache
# (128^2 * 2 KiB = ~33MB). To find a record, we need 2 random node lookup in DRAM and 1 dependent random lookup in PMem.
# For 1024/512 Byte inner/leaf nodes, we assume 7 levels, where root + 2 levels fit into cache (~4 MB).
# For 512/256 Byte inner/leaf nodes, we assume 8 levels, where root + 3 levels fit into cache (~16 MB).

# To write an entry, FPTree performs 3 flushes, one for the data, one for the fingerprint, and one for the slot index.
# The data is randomly positioned in the node and the other two flushes are at te head.
# An insertion is a lookup, followed by the record entry. We use the same sizes as above.
